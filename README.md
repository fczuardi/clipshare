# ClipShare

**ClipShare** is a serverless screen recording application built as an open-source alternative to Loom. It empowers users to effortlessly record their screens, optionally capture camera footage, and seamlessly upload the recordings to an S3-compatible storage service. Powered by Electron, ClipShare offers a cross-platform solution that's both powerful and easy to deploy.

## üèÅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6 or higher)
- An S3-compatible storage service (e.g., AWS S3, MinIO, DigitalOcean Spaces)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

   ```plaintext
   ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key
   ACCESS_SECRET=your_secret_key
   ENDPOINT=https://s3.yourservice.com
   REGION=us-east-1
   BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
   URL_PREFIX=https://your-custom-domain.com/
   ```

   Note: `URL_PREFIX` is optional. If provided, it will be used as a prefix for the uploaded file URLs.

### Building the Application

To build ClipShare for your platform:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command packages the application and places it in the `dist/` directory.

### Running the Application

For development:

```bash
npm start
```

For production, run the packaged application from the `dist/` directory.

## üìò Usage

1. **Launch**: Start ClipShare from your applications menu or use auto-launch.
2. **Access**: Click the tray icon to open the main interface.
3. **Record**: Choose your recording options and click "Start Recording".
4. **Stop**: Click "Stop Recording" when finished.
5. **Share**: After automatic upload, use the provided URL to share your recording.

## üè† Self-Hosted Setup

If you don't intend to use an external S3 service, you can set up a MinIO docker container for local storage. Here's an example `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  minio:
    image: minio/minio
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"
      - "9001:9001"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    environment:
      MINIO_ROOT_USER: your_access_key
      MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD: your_secret_key
    command: server /data --console-address ":9001"
```

To use this setup:

1. Save the above content in a `docker-compose.yml` file.
2. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the MinIO server.
3. Access the MinIO console at `http://localhost:9001` and create a bucket.
4. Update your `.env` file with the following:

   ```plaintext
   ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key
   ACCESS_SECRET=your_secret_key
   ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9000
   REGION=us-east-1
   BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
   ```

This configuration allows you to use ClipShare with a self-hosted S3-compatible storage solution.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **Environment Variables**: Ensure your `.env` file is correctly formatted and in the root directory.
- **Auto-Launch Issues**: Check your system's startup application settings.
- **Recording Quality**: Adjust bitrate and resolution in the app settings for optimal performance.
